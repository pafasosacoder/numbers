Ejercicio Back End Developer:

Create a Rest API that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number, for the multiples of five output “Buzz” and for the multiples of seven output “Jazz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”, for numbers which are multiples of three and seven output “FizzJazz”, for numbers which are multiples of five and seven output “BuzzJazz”,  for multiples of three, five and seven output “FizzBuzzJazz” and so on.

Plus: 

Implement the necessary unit tests to validate correct working of the API.
Implement a log process to save all requests into the database.
